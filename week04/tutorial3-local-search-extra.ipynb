    "## Evolutionary Algorithms & The Travelling Salesman Problem\n",
    "[Evolutionary Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm) (EAs) represent a class of optimisation and search algorithms inspired by the biological evolution process. These algorithms aim to discover solutions to complex problems where traditional methods may prove impractical or ineffective. EAs function by maintaining a population of potential solutions and iteratively evolving them over generations. Each generation involves selecting chromosomes with advantageous traits, applying genetic operators like mutation and crossover to generate new chromosomes, and substituting less fit chromosomes with the newly created ones. This iterative process continues until a satisfactory solution is generated, or a predefined stopping criterion is satisfied. EAs have found successful applications in various domains, including engineering, finance, and machine learning.\n",

In the TSP, the goal is to find the shortest possible route that allows a salesperson to visit a set of locations exactly once and return to the starting city. This problem has real-world applications in logistics, transportation, and circuit design. The TSP is NP-Hard, meaning that as the number of locations increases, finding the optimal solution becomes increasingly complex and time-consuming. Various algorithms are employed to efficiently approximate solutions to the TSP, enabling practical use in route planning and optimisation scenarios.

In the world of evolutionary computation, it's the act of creating the initial set of potential solutions or `Chromosome`s, often referred to as the population. These `Chromosome`s undergo a series of genetic operations such as selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve towards better solutions over generations.\n",

After evaluating their fitness values, the population size is reduced to its intended size. While theoretically resulting in a fitter population, this isn't guaranteed.\n",

    "1. **Bit Flip Mutation:** Typically used in binary-encoded problems, this method randomly flips individual bits in the genetic representation. It's a simple yet effective way to introduce variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Swap Mutation:** For permutation-based problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), swap mutation selects two positions at random and swaps the elements at those positions. This preserves the integrity of the permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inversion Mutation:** In this technique, a randomly selected subset of the genetic material is inverted. In permutation-based problems, this means reversing the order of a portion of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Gaussian Mutation:** Commonly employed in real-valued optimization problems, Gaussian mutation adds a small, normally-distributed random value to each gene. It allows for fine-grained adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Boundary Mutation:** Applicable to problems with defined boundaries, boundary mutation perturbs genes towards the boundary values. It's used to explore extreme regions of the solution space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of a mutation technique and its parameters depends on the problem domain and the level of diversity needed. Mutation rates and other parameters can be adjusted to control the extent of mutation."

    "#### Replacement\n",
    "\n",
    "Replacement is a pivotal process within EAs that determines which individuals from the current population will make it to the next generation. This crucial step influences the algorithm's ability to preserve diversity, maintain progress, and refine solutions towards optimality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of replacement as nature's way of selecting individuals to continue the evolutionary journey. In EAs, replacement decides which individuals will be retained for the next generation and which will make way for new offspring. It's a balancing act between preserving the best solutions found so far and allowing new genetic material to contribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Replacement Techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generational Replacement:** In this method, the entire current population is replaced by the offspring generated in the current generation. This approach promotes rapid exploration but may lead to the loss of well-performing individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Elitism:** Elitism ensures that the best-performing individuals from the current generation are directly carried over to the next without any changes. It safeguards the top solutions and prevents them from being lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Steady-State Replacement:** In steady-state replacement, a subset of the population is replaced by offspring, while some individuals from the current generation are retained. This maintains a balance between preserving good solutions and introducing diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Age-Based Replacement:** In age-based replacement, individuals in the population are assigned ages, and the oldest individuals are replaced. This approach encourages the retirement of less promising solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of a replacement technique influences the exploration-exploitation trade-off in an EA. Depending on the problem and the desired algorithm behavior, you can tailor the replacement strategy to your specific needs."

    "Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are powerful optimization techniques that mimic the process of natural selection to solve complex problems. They are composed of several essential components, including initialisation, selection, crossover, mutation, and replacement. Here, we'll piece these elements together and provide pseudocode for a modular EA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialisation:**\n",
    "- Begin by creating an initial population of individuals, representing potential solutions to the problem.\n",
    "- Each individual is generated using a specific initialisation strategy, which can be random, greedy, seed-based, or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selection:**\n",
    "- Select individuals from the current population to act as parents for the next generation.\n",
    "- The selection process can use techniques like roulette wheel, tournament, rank-based, or stochastic universal sampling (SUS).\n",
    "- High-fitness individuals are more likely to be chosen as parents, promoting the retention of promising traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crossover:**\n",
    "- Combine genetic material from selected parents to create offspring.\n",
    "- Common crossover techniques include one-point, two-point, uniform, arithmetic, and more.\n",
    "- Crossover introduces diversity and helps explore the solution space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutation:**\n",
    "- Apply random changes to the genetic material of individuals.\n",
    "- Mutation can be implemented using techniques like bit flip, swap, inversion, Gaussian, boundary mutation, and others.\n",
    "- It introduces variability and allows exploration of new possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Replacement:**\n",
    "- Decide which individuals from the current population will be replaced by offspring.\n",
    "- Replacement strategies include generational replacement, elitism, steady-state replacement, and age-based replacement.\n",
    "- Balancing the retention of good solutions with the introduction of diversity is key.\n",
