    "## Evolutionary Algorithms & The Travelling Salesman Problem\n",
    "[Evolutionary Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm) (EAs) represent a class of optimisation and search algorithms inspired by the biological evolution process. These algorithms aim to discover solutions to complex problems where traditional methods may prove impractical or ineffective. EAs function by maintaining a population of potential solutions and iteratively evolving them over generations. Each generation involves selecting chromosomes with advantageous traits, applying genetic operators like mutation and crossover to generate new chromosomes, and substituting less fit chromosomes with the newly created ones. This iterative process continues until a satisfactory solution is generated, or a predefined stopping criterion is satisfied. EAs have found successful applications in various domains, including engineering, finance, and machine learning.\n",

    "The [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) (TSP) is a classic combinatorial optimisation challenge. In the TSP, the goal is to find the shortest possible route that allows a salesperson to visit a set of locations exactly once and return to the starting city. This problem has real-world applications in logistics, transportation, and circuit design. The TSP is NP-Hard, meaning that as the number of locations increases, finding the optimal solution becomes increasingly complex and time-consuming. Various algorithms are employed to efficiently approximate solutions to the TSP, enabling practical use in route planning and optimisation scenarios.\n",

    "The mathematical optimisation of this problem can be formalised as:\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Recombination (Crossover):** Pairs of routes are combined to create offspring routes. This process mimics genetic recombination in biology. For example, a crossover operation might involve merging two parent routes to create a new route with characteristics inherited from both parents. Be weary, however; as not all crossover operators are applicable to all problems. This is also known as the exploitation operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Mutation:** Occasionally, random changes are introduced into routes to encourage exploration of new solutions. This process emulates genetic mutations. This is known as the exploration operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Replacement:** Less fit routes are replaced by the newly generated offspring, ensuring that the population evolves over time towards better solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Termination Criterion:** The algorithm continues evolving the population through multiple generations until a termination criterion is met. This could be a specific number of generations, a time limit, or reaching a satisfactory solution.\n",

In the world of evolutionary computation, it's the act of creating the initial set of potential solutions or `Chromosome`s, often referred to as the population. These `Chromosome`s undergo a series of genetic operations such as selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve towards better solutions over generations.\n",

    "Getting the initialisation right is a critical aspect of EA design. Poor initialisation can lead to premature convergence or stagnation, where the algorithm gets stuck in suboptimal solutions. Conversely, a well-crafted initialisation strategy can jumpstart the evolutionary process, helping the algorithm explore the solution space effectively.\n",

    "2. **Augmented Initialisation:** This method involves generating a larger population through the random shuffling of the problem. After evaluating their fitness values, the population size is reduced to its intended size. While theoretically resulting in a fitter population, this isn't guaranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Greedy Initialisation:** In this approach, `Chromosome`s are generated using heuristics or greedy algorithms to construct relatively good initial solutions. It's particularly useful when prior knowledge about the problem domain is available.\n",

    "1. **Roulette Wheel Selection:** This technique assigns a slice of a roulette wheel to each individual based on their fitness. The wheel is then spun, and `Chromosome`s with larger slices have a higher chance of being selected. It's a proportional selection method that promotes diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tournament Selection:** In this approach, a few `Chromosome`s are randomly selected from the population, and the one with the highest fitness among them becomes a parent. Tournament selection is robust and less biased towards high-fitness `Chromosome`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rank-Based Selection:** `Chromosome`s are ranked by fitness, and selection probabilities are assigned based on these ranks. Rank-based selection can strike a balance between exploration and exploitation and is less sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stochastic Universal Sampling (SUS):** SUS is an enhanced version of roulette wheel selection. It selects multiple parents in a single step by evenly spacing points around the wheel. SUS encourages diversity and can improve convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Boltzmann Selection:** Inspired by thermodynamics, this method assigns selection probabilities based on a temperature parameter. It introduces controlled randomness into the selection process, promoting exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Random Selection:** This technique selects two `Chromosome`s at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of a selection technique involves a trade-off between exploration (discovering new areas of the solution space) and exploitation (refining solutions around promising regions). The selection method and parameters directly influence this balance.\n"

    "#### Crossover (Recombination)\n",
    "Crossover is a pivotal process within EAs where individuals from the current population are combined to produce offspring with the aim of creating improved solutions. This essential step draws inspiration from genetic recombination in nature and plays a crucial role in driving EAs towards optimal or near-optimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine nature's way of mixing genetic material during reproduction. In EAs, crossover mimics this by taking genetic material from two parent individuals and creating one or more offspring with characteristics inherited from both. By blending the traits of successful parents, crossover introduces diversity and promotes the exploration of solution space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Crossover Techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One-Point Crossover:** This technique selects a random point along the genetic material of the parents and combines the segments before and after that point. It's a straightforward method that introduces diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Two-Point Crossover:** Similar to one-point crossover, but it selects two random points for crossover. This can lead to more complex recombination of genetic material.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Uniform Crossover:** In this method, each gene (or element) of the offspring is inherited from one of the parents, chosen randomly. It maintains diversity by preserving the genes of both parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Arithmetic Crossover:** Applicable when the genetic material represents continuous values, this technique computes a weighted average of the parents' genes to create the offspring. It's commonly used in real-valued optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Order Crossover (OX):** Primarily used for permutation-based problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem, OX preserves the order of a subset of genes from one parent and fills the remaining positions with genes from the other parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Partially-Mapped Crossover (PMX):** This approach is designed to create offspring by combining genetic material (permutations) from two parent individuals while preserving certain order-based characteristics. It was introduced as an alternative to the Order Crossover (OX) method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of a crossover technique depends on the problem domain and the characteristics of the solution space. Different techniques strike a balance between exploration (creating diverse solutions) and exploitation (combining promising traits). Tuning crossover rates and parameters can further refine an EA's performance."

    "Mutation is a vital process within EAs where individuals undergo small, random changes to their genetic material. This critical step introduces diversity into the population, fostering exploration and enabling EAs to escape local optima in pursuit of optimal or near-optimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of mutation as nature's way of introducing genetic novelty into a population. In EAs, mutation mimics this process by randomly altering the genetic material of individuals. While most changes are subtle, occasional mutations can lead to breakthroughs and the discovery of previously unexplored regions of the solution space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Mutation Techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bit Flip Mutation:** Typically used in binary-encoded problems, this method randomly flips individual bits in the genetic representation. It's a simple yet effective way to introduce variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Swap Mutation:** For permutation-based problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), swap mutation selects two positions at random and swaps the elements at those positions. This preserves the integrity of the permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inversion Mutation:** In this technique, a randomly selected subset of the genetic material is inverted. In permutation-based problems, this means reversing the order of a portion of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Gaussian Mutation:** Commonly employed in real-valued optimization problems, Gaussian mutation adds a small, normally-distributed random value to each gene. It allows for fine-grained adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Boundary Mutation:** Applicable to problems with defined boundaries, boundary mutation perturbs genes towards the boundary values. It's used to explore extreme regions of the solution space.\n",

    "\n",
    "Replacement is a pivotal process within EAs that determines which individuals from the current population will make it to the next generation. This crucial step influences the algorithm's ability to preserve diversity, maintain progress, and refine solutions towards optimality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of replacement as nature's way of selecting individuals to continue the evolutionary journey. In EAs, replacement decides which individuals will be retained for the next generation and which will make way for new offspring. It's a balancing act between preserving the best solutions found so far and allowing new genetic material to contribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Replacement Techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generational Replacement:** In this method, the entire current population is replaced by the offspring generated in the current generation. This approach promotes rapid exploration but may lead to the loss of well-performing individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Elitism:** Elitism ensures that the best-performing individuals from the current generation are directly carried over to the next without any changes. It safeguards the top solutions and prevents them from being lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Steady-State Replacement:** In steady-state replacement, a subset of the population is replaced by offspring, while some individuals from the current generation are retained. This maintains a balance between preserving good solutions and introducing diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Age-Based Replacement:** In age-based replacement, individuals in the population are assigned ages, and the oldest individuals are replaced. This approach encourages the retirement of less promising solutions.\n",

    "#### Piecing it all Together\n",
    "\n",
    "Evolutionary algorithms are powerful optimization techniques that mimic the process of natural selection to solve complex problems. They are composed of several essential components, including initialisation, selection, crossover, mutation, and replacement. Here, we'll piece these elements together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialisation:**\n",
    "- Begin by creating an initial population of individuals, representing potential solutions to the problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Selection:**\n",
    "- Select individuals from the current population to act as parents for the next generation.\n",
    "- The selection process can use techniques like roulette wheel, tournament, rank-based, or stochastic universal sampling (SUS).\n",
    "- High-fitness individuals are more likely to be chosen as parents, promoting the retention of promising traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crossover:**\n",
    "- Combine genetic material from selected parents to create offspring.\n",
    "- Common crossover techniques include one-point, two-point, uniform, arithmetic, and more.\n",
    "- Crossover introduces diversity and helps explore the solution space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutation:**\n",
    "- Apply random changes to the genetic material of individuals.\n",
    "- Mutation can be implemented using techniques like bit flip, swap, inversion, Gaussian, boundary mutation, and others.\n",
    "- It introduces variability and allows exploration of new possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Replacement:**\n",
    "- Decide which individuals from the current population will be replaced by offspring.\n",
    "- Replacement strategies include generational replacement, elitism, steady-state replacement, and age-based replacement.\n",
